## 📣 How to Market This Project?

### **TL;DR: Start with Personal LinkedIn, Not Business Page**

#### Why Personal LinkedIn?
- ✅ You already have connections
- ✅ Higher engagement than business pages
- ✅ Great for job search (shows your skills)
- ✅ Free and immediate reach
- ✅ More authentic

#### Why Wait on Business Page?
- ❌ Zero initial followers
- ❌ Lower organic reach
- ❌ Better for established brands
- ⏰ Consider after 500+ users
