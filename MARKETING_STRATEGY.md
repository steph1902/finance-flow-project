### LinkedIn Business Page - **OPTIONAL FOR LATER** ⏰

**When to Create Business Page:**
- ✅ When you have 500+ users
- ✅ When you want to establish brand separate from personal brand
- ✅ When you're ready to run LinkedIn ads
- ✅ When you have a content team

**Why Wait:**
- ❌ Zero initial followers (have to build from scratch)
- ❌ Lower organic reach than personal posts
- ❌ Requires consistent posting (3-5x/week)
- ❌ Better for established brands, not early-stage

**If You Create It:**
```
Company Name: FinanceFlow
Tagline: "Smart Personal Finance Management"
Industry: Software Development / Financial Technology
Size: 1 employee (or 2-10 if growing)
Description: [Use elevator pitch]
Website: finance-flow.vercel.app
```

**Business Page Strategy:**
- Cross-post from personal profile
- Share user testimonials
- Post feature updates
- Share blog content
- Invite connections to follow

5. More authentic storytelling

**Add Business Page Later** when:
- You have 500+ users
